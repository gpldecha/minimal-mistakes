This the very first post I have done whilst using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to statically generate
my website which is hosted on github. Many thanks Michael Rose for his awesome theme
[Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)

I will be keeping updates on insights I gained throughout my Ph.D which I obtained from EPFL.

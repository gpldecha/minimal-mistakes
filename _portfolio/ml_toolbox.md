During my time as Ph.D at the LASA group in EPFL I developed a [Machine Learning toolbox](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/ML_toolbox)
for an advanced machine learning class with my fellow teaching assistant colleges. My contributions included the
following components:

* Toolbox structure
* Exercises on Kernel-PCA methods for cluster discovery
* Reinforcement Learning component.
